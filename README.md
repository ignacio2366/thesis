# Request for Free API NEWS REQUEST


Dear to NewsCatcher API,

Good day, I'm Mark Angelo F. Ignacio student at Cavite State University in the Philippines as free tuition or scholar. I am requesting a free news API request for our thesis project in a computer science course titled A News Editor with Plagiarism Checker and Insight Analysis Natural Language Process API for Digital Marketing Philippines.

 One of the best features of NewsCatcher News API (newscatcherapi.com)  is compiling the news from different sources on one web page and searching the news using query posts. We discovered that the most efficient API is the news catcher that can rank the top sources in media news from the Philippines.Thank you.

The feature we would like to request is a 10000 or free request
can search past 3months' news
can be used for at least 6months

Big thanks
